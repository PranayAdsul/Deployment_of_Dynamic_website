# Deployment_of_Dynamic_website
In this project, we successfully deployed a dynamic website using AWS EC2 (Elastic 
Compute Cloud) and implemented a scalable, reliable database solution using AWS RDS 
(Relational Database Service). The EC2 instance served as the web server, hosting the 
dynamic website, while AWS RDS was utilized for securely storing and managing the 
website's data in a managed relational database. 
Key takeaways from the project include: 
1. Scalability: AWS EC2 instances provided the flexibility to scale the web server as per 
the traffic demands, ensuring that the website can handle varying loads efficiently. 
2. Reliability and Availability: By utilizing AWS RDS, we ensured that the database is 
highly available and can automatically scale according to the storage and performance 
requirements, reducing the chances of downtime or data loss. 
3. Security: The integration of security groups and proper configuration of AWS IAM 
roles ensured that both the EC2 instance and RDS database were securely accessible, 
providing a secure environment for hosting sensitive data. 
4. Cost Efficiency: AWSâ€™s pay-as-you-go pricing model allowed us to optimize costs by 
only paying for the resources that were actively being used, making it a cost-effective 
solution for deploying a dynamic website.
